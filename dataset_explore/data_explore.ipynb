    "In this study, participants went through two phases: an encoding phase and a recognition phase. In the encoding phase, they were shown 100 new images from different categories and had to decide if each image contained an animal. Later, in the recognition phase, they were shown 100 images, half of which were from the earlier phase and half were new. Participants had to say whether each image was \"old\" (seen before) or \"novel\" (new) and rate how confident they were on a scale from 1 to 6.\n",

    "To study neural activity during these tasks, researchers used hybrid depth electrodes with embedded microwires to record signals from single neurons in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL). The signals were recorded at a high sampling rate and then filtered and processed offline for spike detection and sorting using a template-matching algorithm. "
